This repository contains all the code that was written while we produce the paper:
Z. Huang, E. Ayday, J. Fellay, J.-P. Hubaux and A. Juels. GenoGuard: Protecting Genomic Data against Brute-Force Attacks. 36th IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (S&P 2015), San Jose, CA, USA, 2015.

For those who want to try using GenoGuard, please read only the file GenoGuard.py, which is the implementation of honey encryption with the proposed DTE models on genomic data. And this file is well-commented. I also include a small dataset (part of chromosome 22) in ./honey_encryption/hapmap/chr22 for you to run the code successfully.

All other codes are just auxiliary for conducting the experiments and producing figures in the paper. It is hard and tiring to comment them. Yup, they are not important. But if you are indeed so ambitious to conduct those experiments by yourself, please contact me (zhicong.huang@epfl.ch). Let's discuss.
